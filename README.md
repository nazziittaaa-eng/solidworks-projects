# SolidWorks Mechanical Assembly Project

### Overview
This project showcases a **mechanical assembly** modeled in **SolidWorks 2025** as part of my practice in 3D mechanical design.  
It includes several standard machine components â€” such as gears, shafts, pins, and a universal joint â€” combined into a complete assembly to demonstrate understanding of 3D modeling and assembly structure.

### Objective
The goal of this project was to develop a stronger foundation in:
- 3D part modeling and dimensioning in SolidWorks  
- Creating assemblies from multiple components  
- Applying mates and constraints for proper alignment  
- Structuring and exporting models for presentation and documentation  

### Components
The assembly includes:
- **Gear** â€“ used for power transmission  
- **Shaft** â€“ supports and connects rotating components  
- **Pin / Coupling** â€“ provides alignment and fastening  
- **Universal Joint** â€“ demonstrates component connection between misaligned axes  
- Additional small parts and connectors  

### Tools & Environment
- **Software:** SolidWorks 2025  
- **Export Tool:** eDrawings (for PDF conversion)  
- **Category:** 3D CAD / Mechanical Design Practice  
- **File Types:** `.PDF` (exported), originally `.SLDPRT` and `.SLDASM`

### Files in this Repository
This repository contains PDF exports of my SolidWorks 2025 designs and screenshots:

- `Assem1.pdf` â€“ first assembly  
- `Assem2.pdf` â€“ second assembly  
- `gear.pdf` â€“ gear part  
- `shaft.pdf` â€“ shaft part  
- `pin.pdf` â€“ pin part  
- `collar.pdf` â€“ collar part  
- `fork.pdf` â€“ fork part  
- `center block.pdf` â€“ center block part  
- `1 pt1.pdf` & `1 pt2.pdf` â€“ additional parts  
- `Screenshot 2025-08-2...` â€“ image of assembly or part

### Viewing the Project
All files are provided as **PDF exports** created with *eDrawings for SolidWorks 2025*.  
This allows anyone to view the designs without needing SolidWorks installed.

To view the models:
1. Open any file in the `PDF_Exports` folder.  
2. Use **Adobe Acrobat Reader** (or another PDF viewer).  
3. Files are static â€” for presentation and documentation purposes only.

> *Note: These PDFs are not interactive 3D models.*

### Key Features
- Accurate 3D models of basic mechanical components  
- Proper use of SolidWorks assembly constraints  
- Clean part organization and naming structure  
- Exported documentation-quality PDF files  

### Learning Outcomes
- Improved modeling efficiency and design organization  
- Better understanding of assembly workflow and constraints  
- Practical experience in preparing designs for documentation and sharing
