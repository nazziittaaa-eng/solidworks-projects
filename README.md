# SolidWorks Project

SolidWorks CAD models created in **SolidWorks 2025**.

## 📂 Contents
- **Bracket Mount** – structural bracket with bolt holes and rib reinforcements  
- **Gear Shaft Assembly** – shaft with spur gear and keyed features  
- **Universal Joint (U-Joint) Assembly** – coupling mechanism with two yokes and a cross shaft, used to transmit rotary motion between shafts at an angle  

## 🛠️ Notes
- File types: `.SLDPRT`, `.SLDASM` (SolidWorks 2025 format)  
- CAD files are binary, so Git cannot show line-by-line differences  
- Consider [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/) for large files  

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<nazziittaaa-eng>/solidworks-projects.git
## 🎯 Project Purpose
This project was created as part of my learning and practice in SolidWorks 2025, modeling basic mechanical components and assemblies.
